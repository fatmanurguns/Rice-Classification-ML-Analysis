# Rice-Classification-ML-Analysis
A comparative study on classifying Cammeo and Osmancik rice varieties using Machine Learning algorithms with a comprehensive literature review.

Rice Variety Classification with Machine Learning
This project focuses on the classification of two different types of rice (Cammeo and Osmancik) using various machine learning algorithms. It includes both a technical implementation and a formal academic report.

 Project Overview
Objective: To accurately classify rice varieties based on their morphological features.

Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM.

Key Components
Literature Review: A detailed analysis of existing methodologies in grain classification.

Model Evaluation: Comparison of models based on Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.

Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

Developed as part of the Data Mining curriculum at Başkent University.
